# Noboty Practice Bot Code

> Code for the 2018 practice bot

## Noboty?
Noboty is a play on words from Team 118's Everybot. We called it this because nobody will use it.

## Controls
We used a one-joystick control system for sake of convenience. Moving the joystick on the Y axis moves the robot forwards or backwards, and the X axis causes it to rotate.

### Sarah mode
This mode cuts the speed of the robot in half, for precision movement in confined areas as well as a simple safety precaution for inexperienced drivers. Sarah mode was created when Sarah, a member of our team, smashed the robot into a wall at full speed. It is activated by pressing the red button on the joystick.
